# LangNews
The News Research Tool is an LLM-powered application that enables users to input news article URLs and ask questions about the content.By integrating OpenAIâ€™s Large Language Model and LangChain, the tool processes and splits the articles into chunks, creates vector embeddings using the LLM, and stores them in a FAISS vector database for fast retrieval. The system allows users to query the articles in natural language, and the LLM retrieves the most relevant sections, providing accurate, context-aware answers.

This project combines the power of large-scale language models and retrieval-based frameworks, making it ideal for researchers, journalists, or anyone looking to extract insights from multiple news sources in real time. The intuitive Streamlit interface simplifies interaction with the underlying LLM architecture, offering a user-friendly experience without requiring deep technical knowledge. is that good
